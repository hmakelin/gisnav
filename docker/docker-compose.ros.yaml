# This Docker Compose file is part of the GISNav project configuration.
# It defines a reusable configuration layer that sets up the necessary
# environment variables and volumes for ROS (Robot Operating System) applications.

# Note: A dds network in the networking file (not here in this file) is included
# to enable Fast DDS to communicate over the network stack instead of only
# relying on the shared memory devices mounted here in this file

name: gisnav

# x-ros is an anchor that holds the common ROS configuration.
# This includes setting environment variables and mounting necessary volumes.

    # Set the ROS_DOMAIN_ID for ROS 2 DDS (Data Distribution Service) communication
