SITL tests
____________________________________________________
SITL tests are under the ``test/sitl`` folder. Use the below ``make`` command to run the
SITL test:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/colcon_ws/src/gisnav
    make test-sitl

.. note::
    The script assumes you have already built the services defined in the
    ``docker-compose.yaml`` file.

Flight Log Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The flight log generated by the SITL test can be analyzed with the Jupyter notebooks in ``test/ulog_analysis`` folder.
You must first start ``jupyter-notebook``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/px4_ros_com_ros2/src/gisnav/test/sitl/ulog_analysis
    jupyter-notebook

The notebook documents the analysis and displays the results. Download the example ULog file from Google Drive `here
