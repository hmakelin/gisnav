# This Docker Compose file is part of the GISNav project configuration.
# It defines a reusable configuration layer that enables GUI applications
# in specific services by setting up necessary environment variables,
# volumes, and devices for X11 forwarding.

name: gisnav

# x-x11 is an anchor that holds the configuration needed to enable GUI applications
# to display using the host's X11 server. This includes setting environment variables,
# mounting necessary volumes, and exposing the required devices.

  environment:
    # Disable MIT-SHM extension to avoid shared memory issues
